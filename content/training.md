**Ramsoc needs leaders!**Â - So we're always on the look out for enthusiastic people to try their hand at walk leading. There's no pressure to lead walks after doing the training, but many people find it's a great way to get more involved in the club and find it very rewarding!
## Grade 2
### Introduction
Grade 2 training consists of a 1 day practical course and Thursday evening theory session. To build up grade 2 walking experience, the practical day is run in grade 2 territory in the north of the Peak District. The course has been designed especially for the Rambling Society's needs. All leaders running the training all have widespread experience of leading grades 2 and 3 walks.

Places are limited on this course as a very large training group would lower the teaching quality. However, there are two separate grade 2 training courses to be run this year. ([Check Dates](/walks)) They are separated by a few months to allow trainees to practice their leading skills and allows us to get a bigger intake. 

The course is subsidised and so is only open to those members who are serious about leading grade 2 walks and helping the society. A small charge will be made to each trainee to cover transport costs and pizza!

## Grade 3
### Introduction
A Grade 3 leader must have widespread experience of leading lower grades of walk and be familiar with walking in mountainous terrain. For this reason, grade 3 training must be done in mountainous terrain. Ramsoc runs a three day course in Lake District to allow trainees to build up valuable mountain experience and also cover all aspects of mountain walk leading. The course has been designed especially for the Rambling Society's needs. As well as practical training during the day, theory material has been organised for the evening (1-2 hours) making for an intensive and arduous few days. The course has been organised by current Ramsoc members in conjunction with the Students Union. All members of the organising team have widespread experience of leading grade 3 walks.

Places are limited on this course as a very large training group would lower the teaching quality. The course is heavily subsidised so is only open to those members who are serious about leading grade 3 mountainous walks and would therefore be an asset to the society. A charge will be made to each trainee to cover their accommodation costs.

### Course Content
#### Evening Theory Session
- Leader responsibilities
- Party management
- Mountain hazards (terrain, people, weather etc.)
- Incident management
- Ramsoc procedures
- Mountain Rescue
- Equipment and clothing

#### Practical Day Sessions

- Mountain navigation practice.
- Improvised carries and shelter.
- Security on steep ground techniques.
- Steep ground route finding.
- Communication skills.
- Full practice day where everyone has a chance to lead. Other trainees act out scenarios for the current leader to deal with.

It must be stressed that the training alone will not automatically make people grade 3. After liaising with the course organisers, it is at the rambling secretary's and the safety officer's discretion who meets grade 3 leader standards. No-one will be allowed or expected to lead a grade 3 walk alone straight after such a training course. Trainees will be given the opportunity to lead a grade 3 walk under the supervision of the more experienced members until they have gained enough experience and skills to lead alone.
