Having the right kit is the most important requirement when attending our events. If you turn up to a hike with the wrong kit and leaders deem your gear inappropriate, you will be unable to participate and regrettably cannot be refunded. As stated by our [Hikers Operating Procedures](/hop). 
## Sunday Hike Essentials
- Walking Boots - **NOT TRAINERS** - Walking boots are touch soles, ankle support and some level of waterproofing. 
- Suitable trousers for walking - **NOT JEANS**
- 2L of Water (3L on long or hot days)
- Backpack (20-30 litres is ideal)
- Waterproof Coat 
- Lunch and snacks
- Warm Layers - Especially during our colder months. (Don't forget those hats and gloves)
