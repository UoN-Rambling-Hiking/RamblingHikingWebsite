Rise and shine Ramblers! Our walks today will be taking place around Hayfield, 
predominantly on the western side of the Kinder Scout moorland plateau (the highest point 
in the Peak District at an elevation of 636m). ‘The Mass Trespass’ occurred around here on 
the 24th April, 1932. Hundreds of protesters defied the law by trespassing onto the prohibited 
Kinder Scout via William Clough and scuffled with landowners and gamekeepers. The harsh 
punishments for the protest organisers led to a public outcry which fuelled the ‘right to roam 
movement’ on open access land and led to the formation of the Peak District National Park. 
Some of the routes pass Kinder Downfall, the tallest Waterfall in the Peak District with a 
30m drop, and famous for flowing in reverse with the presence of strong winds. It also has
spectacular views west towards Kinder Reservoir.
