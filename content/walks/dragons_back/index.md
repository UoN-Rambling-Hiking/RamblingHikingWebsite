To celebrate our first Sunday walk in the Chinese Year of the Dragon (龍年快乐) our walks today will be
taking place on and around the Dragon’s Back in the Peak District. The Dragon’s Back is the colloquial
name given to Chrome and Parkhouse Hills, the sharp limestone ‘miniature mountains’ rising from the
pastures of the Upper Dove Valley. You can decide whether these iconic peaks were formed from a
prehistoric coral reef or are actually in fact turf-covered spine of a sleeping dragon!

We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walk 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walk 3a and 3b are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking
pace with fewer stops.
Walk 4 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only. This walk is only available to
members who have competently completed a Sunday or Weekend Away walk in the past.
