Croeso i Gymru - Welcome to Wales! For our first day in Snowdonia (Eryri) we will attempt
to summit Snowdon (Yr Wyddfa), the highest mountain in Wales and England at an
elevation of 1085m above sea level. Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay trained on the
slopes of Snowdon the winter before they successfully became the first people in history to
reach the summit Mount Everest in 1953. Hopefully our walks today will be less formidable
than conquering Everest!

We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walk 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with lots of photo opportunities.
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.

Walk 5 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only.

Today we will be travelling to Southern Snowdonia (Eryri) to visit the majestic Cadair Idris.
Cadair Idris derives its name meaning ‘Chair of Idris’, Idris being a giant from Welsh
mythology. The mountain consists of an 11km long ridge and its summit, called Penygadair,
has an elevation of 893m. Despite being the 19th highest mountain in Wales, the rugged
Cadair Idris is one of the ‘Welsh 3 Peaks’, simply due to its notoriety and beauty.

We are offering up to 3 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walk 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
