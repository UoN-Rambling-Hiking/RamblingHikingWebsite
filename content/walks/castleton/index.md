Welcome to the final Sunday walk of the academic year which will be around Castleton,
which is home to 4 show caves and the imposing Peveril Castle, in the heart of the Peak
District National Park. Castleton is a charming village at the head of the Hope Valley and at
the convergence of the gritstone ‘Dark Peak’ to the north featuring moorland plateaus and
the limestone ‘White Peak’ to the south, characterised by gently rolling hills dissected by
beautiful dales. The most prominent local geographic feature is the Great Ridge running
between Mam Tor and Lose Hill. Have a great walk and we hope to see you again next year!
