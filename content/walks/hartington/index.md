Happy New Year Ramblers, welcome to Ramsoc’s first walk of 2024! Our walks today will be
taking place around Hartington, the home of cheese-making in Derbyshire – a visit to ‘The
Old Cheese Shop’ is essential! Hartington is adjacent to the River Dove which has eroded
some of the most beautiful dales in the Peak District, notably the spectacular ravine of
Wolfscote Dale and the intimate wooded Beresford Dale. Walks 2 to 4 begin in the
magnificent Manifold Valley which is dominated by the lofty arch of Thor’s Cave.
