Welcome to Ramsoc’s first walk of the academic year! Our walk today will be taking place on
and around Shutlingsloe, colloquially known as the ‘Matterhorn of Cheshire’. At an elevation
of 506m above sea level, it has a punishing ascent which is eventually rewarded with
spectacular views of the surrounding countryside.

We are offering up to 5 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 1 and 2 are ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
Walk 5 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only. This walk is only available to
members who have competently completed a walk 4 in the past.
