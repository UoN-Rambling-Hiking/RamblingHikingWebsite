<p>Ramsoc's third weekend away of the 2024/25 year is to Stainforth in the Yorkshire Dales National Park!!! The trip will take place on 14th-16th February. Tickets cost £70 and include transport, accommodation and a meal. Fill in this form to register your interest in the trip before 3rd February when places will be allocated. You can still sign up after this date, although it is likely you will be placed on the waiting list. Keep an eye on your emails to find out if you have a space.</p>

<p>Places will be allocated first to our leaders, first aiders and minibus drivers and then on to members with the highest attendance at the club’s hiking-based events. If you are a non-member you are welcome to sign up, however our members will receive priority and you will be required to purchase a membership should you get a space. 41 spaces are available.</p>

<p>Requirements to attend that are non-negotiable:
<ul>
<li>Must have purchased a membership through the SU for the 2024/25 year, before the start of the trip.</li>
<li>Must bring a suitable pair of hiking boots</li>
<li>Must bring a suitable waterproof jacket and suitable trousers</li>
<li>Must bring a sleeping bag</li>
<li>Must be available to leave campus at 4pm on the Friday</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If there is any doubt around what kit is needed then please find the pinned post on our Instagram page (@uon_rambling_hiking) or get in touch if you are still unsure.</p>
