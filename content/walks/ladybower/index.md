{{< generalInfo >}}
Good morning Ramblers! Our walks today will be taking place around Ladybower Reservoir
and the Upper Derwent Valley, sometimes referred to as Derbyshire’s Lake District. The
valley offers spectacular scenery with several picturesque reservoirs and their respective
dams, surrounded by serene forests, remote moorland and rugged edges.

We are offering up to 5 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 1 and 2 are ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
Walk 5 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only. This walk is only available to
members who have competently completed a walk 4 in the past.

Please be honest with your capabilities. We can advise you on which walks would be best for you; if you
are unsure, we are happy to help!
