{{< walks >}}
{{< generalInfo >}}
Our walks today will be taking place around Edale, a charming village surrounded by some of
the most stunning scenery in the Peak District. The village is circled by the towering slopes of
the Kinder Scout plateau (the highest point in the National Park at an elevation of 636m) to
the north and the Great Ridge running between Mam Tor and Lose Hill to the south. Edale is
also the official start point of the iconic 431km Pennine Way National Trail, arguably the
UK’s most famous long-distance walk. For all these reasons Edale is very attractive to hikers
and a favourite among much of our walk leaders and committee!

We are offering up to 5 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
Walk 5 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only. This walk is only available to
members who have competently completed a walk 4 in the past.
Please be honest with your capabilities. We can advise you on which walks would be best for you; if you
are unsure, we are happy to help!
