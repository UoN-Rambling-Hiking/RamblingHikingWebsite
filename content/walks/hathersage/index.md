Nestled in the Hope Valley, the quaint village of Hathersage is encircled by wooded hillsides
and dramatic gritstone egdes. Stanage Edge in particular is a very famous location for rock
climbing. Hathersage is known as the outdoor hub of the Peak District, not only for its scenic
backdrop but also for its reputable outdoors shops such as ‘Outside.co.uk’ and ‘Alpkit’.
Hathersage is also historically meritable, it has the reputed grave of Little John – Robin
Hood’s lieutenant. Additionally, many of the locations in Charlotte Brontë’s novel ‘Jane Eyre’
were inspired by Hathersage and the local area, ‘Thornfield Hall’ being a literary rendition of
North Lees Hall.

We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walk 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).

Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.

Walk 5 is a very fast-paced walk, for strong, experienced hikers only. This walk is only available to
members who have competently completed a walk 4 in the past.
