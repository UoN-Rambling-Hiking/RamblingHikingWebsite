Top o’the mornin’ to ya! Our walks today will explore the Peak District’s western edge, The
Roaches. ‘This is my favourite Peak District walk location,’ Fionn – Ramble Secretery. All the
walks will traverse sections of this impressive gritstone ridge which, until a final sighting in
2009, was home to a colony of wild roaming Australian wallabies which escaped a private zoo

in the 1930s. Some of the routes meander through Lud’s Church, a deep, vibrant green moss-
covered chasm with an otherworldly character. All the walks finish in Flash, the highest

village in Britain at an altitude of 463m. Happy St. Patrick’s Day!
