{{< generalInfo >}}
For those of you who are walking with us for the first time - Welcome to Ramsoc! On today’s
walk we will be exploring beautiful Dovedale, one of the most famous places in the Peak
District. Dovedale features a steep wooded ravine with incredible limestone formations such
as pillars and caves, and of course the picturesque Dovedale Stepping Stones.
We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 1 and 2 are ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
