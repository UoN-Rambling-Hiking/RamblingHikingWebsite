Merry Christmas and welcome to Ramsoc’s final walk of the term! Our walks today will
explore the countryside surrounding the picturesque historic market town of Bakewell in
what is known as the ‘White Peak’, a gently rolling limestone plateau dissected by beautiful
dales. Bakewell is famous for its tarts and puddings, and we recommend you reward yourself
with a visit to the bakery at the end of the walk!
We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 1 and 2 are ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in Bakewell).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
