Good morning Ramblers! Today we will be walking along a section of the west-facing
gritstone escapement that forms the eastern rim of the River Derwent. The area is famous
for rock climbers, and is collectively known by them as the ‘Eastern Grit’. Froggatt and
Curbar Edge offer the most dramatic views. Some of the walks will also include a visit to
Padley Gorge, a majestic ancient woodland with tumbling waterfalls and the foliage is even
more picturesque in Autumn!

We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walks 2 is ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.

Please be honest with your capabilities. We can advise you on which walks would be best for you; if you
are unsure, we are happy to help!
