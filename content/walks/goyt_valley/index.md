The Goyt Valley combines picturesque reservoir, river, moorland and woodland scenery. The
western side of the valley is a long ridge running from Windgather Rocks to Shining Tor,
which is the highest hill in Cheshire at an elevation of 559m above sea level. The valley floor
was flooded in 1938 to create Fernilee Reservoir resulting in the demolition of Errwood Hall
to prevent any pollution, the ruins of the hall are still accessible!
We are offering up to 4 walks today, ranging in length and difficulty, which are described below.
Walk 1 and 2 are ideal for those new to hiking or enjoy a social, slow-paced walk with plenty of photo
opportunities (and a bit longer in the pub).
Walks 3 and 4 are more challenging, covering more distance and ascent. They require a faster walking pace
with fewer stops.
