This is the main upstream source for [Official Rambling and Hiking Site](https://github.com/UoN-Rambling-Hiking/RamblingHikingWebsite)

## How it's made
The website core dependencies are:
 * [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)
 * [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome for both updating our Calendar and improving the website.

## Run locally
1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/dan-lee76/ramsoc.git`
2. Install hugo [this guide may help](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/#step-1-install-hugo)
3. Start development server `hugo server -F --disableFastRender` because there are some annoying things that can happen during dev if run with just `hugo server`
